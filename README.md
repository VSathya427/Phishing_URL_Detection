# Phishing_URL_Detection

The Phishing URL dataset is trained on 5 different algorithms. Then, their accuracy scores are compared.The best scoring algorithm is then sent to the flasking application. The flask application is written in python. When a user inputs an url, it goes through the feature extraction process and then these features are fed to the model to give an output. The output relates to the fact whether the url is Phishing or not.

## Running the app 
Clone the whole repo and open the **app_final.ipynb** notebook in jupyter or colab and make sure that **.sav file, templates directory** and the **static directory** are in the same folder as the notebook.Now run all the cells in app_final.ipynb and you will be good to go.
